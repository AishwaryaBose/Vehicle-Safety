Predict injury levels of vehicle occupants using Bayesian Models 

INTRODUCTION:

A sample dataset on ‘US Vehicle Crash’ is analyzed to build and compare Bayesian Network Prediction Models - Naïve Bayes and Tree Augmented Naïve Bayes model. 

DATASET: 

A subset of the data published by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) having a wide range of attributes (General Vehicle Record, Occupant Assessment Record, Exterior Vehicle Record). The model is built to predict the likely injury levels of Vehicle Occupants.

OBJECTIVE:

The primary objective of Bayesian Model is to allocate credibility across parameter values. In addition to this, the model also aims at interpreting the posterior distribution with respect to theoretically meaningful issues (if the model is a reasonable description of the data).

Having the historical data about the road accidents, the objective is to develop a credibility algorithm which would not only predict the injury levels of vehicle occupants but also assist in interpreting the probabilistic impact of various attributes on the injury levels.
